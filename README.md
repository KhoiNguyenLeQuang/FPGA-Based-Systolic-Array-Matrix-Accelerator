# FPGA-Based Systolic Array Matrix Accelerator

## Language: Verilog 

## Platform: Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (Basys 3)

## Overview
This project implements a **Systolic Array Architecture** on an FPGA to accelerate dense matrix multiplication operations ($C = C + A \times B$). Unlike traditional CPU architectures that fetch data sequentially, this design utilizes **parallel Processing Elements (PEs)** and a rhythmic data flow to maximize data reuse and throughput.

This architecture is fundamental to modern AI Accelerators (e.g., Google TPU, NVIDIA Tensor Cores) for Deep Learning inference.

## Architecture
The core is a **NxN Systolic Array** composed of interconnected Processing Elements (PEs).

* **Processing Element (PE):** Performs Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and forwards data to neighbors (Right/Down) in a pipelined fashion.
* **Data Flow:** Matrix A flows horizontally (Left-to-Right), Matrix B flows vertically (Top-to-Bottom).
* **Skewing:** Input data is skewed in time to ensure correct intersection at PEs without pipeline stalls.

## Key Features
* **Fully Pipelined Design:** Achieves O(N) throughput for NxN matrix multiplication.
* **Localized Interconnects:** Minimizes long wire delays, allowing for high clock frequencies.
* **Self-Checking Hardware:** Includes an on-chip verification module that compares computed results against a Golden Model and outputs status via LEDs.
* **Zero-Overhead Control:** State machine-based data feeder requires minimal logic resources.
